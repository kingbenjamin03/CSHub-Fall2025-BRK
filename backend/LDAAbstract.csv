1,ICWS0,Performance Impact of Web Service Migration in Embedded Environments.,"The beginning of 2020 has seen coronavirus spreading to many countries and regions To contain the virus, China adopted, arguably, the most stringent quarantine countermeasures in the country's history concerning restricting people flows, limiting outdoor activities, and extending the Spring Festival break On the one hand, thousands of doctors and nurses directly fought and are still fighting coronavirus in various medical facilities; on the other hand, millions and even billions of residents and tourists self-quarantined and are still self-quarantining themselves in their homes (or temporary homes), fighting the virus in another manner Across cities and regions, which have the highest percentage of \fighters\ at home? To answer this, we downloaded and processed the publicly available Baidu Qianxi (migration) data for 11 consecutive days in 2019 and 2020 Then we geovisualized the answer The visual indicates that several cities in Hubei, as expected, had the highest percentage, followed."
2,ICWS1,Complex Event Processing.,"A large number of distributed applications requires continuous and timely processing of information as it flows from the periphery to the center of the system Examples include intrusion detection systems which analyze network traffic in real-time to identify possible attacks; environmental monitoring applications which process raw data coming from sensor networks to identify critical situations; or applications performing online analysis of stock prices to identify trends and forecast future values Traditional DBMSs, which need to store and index data before processing it, can hardly fulfill the requirements of timeliness coming from such domains Accordingly, during the last decade, different research communities developed a number of tools, which we collectively call Information flow processing (IFP) systems, to support these scenarios They differ in their system architecture, data model, rule model, and rule language In this article, we survey these systems to help researchers, who ."
3,ICWS2,Exploiting Heterogeneous Information for Tag Recommendation in API Management.,"As web-enabled software becomes the standard for business processes, the ways organizations, partners and customers interface with it have become a critical differentiator in the market place, ie, API Economy With the rapid proliferation of APIs, it is increasingly important for users to effectively manage objective APIs in kinds of API markets, eg, ProgramableWeb (PW), Mashape, etc In this paper, to facilitate the process of API management, we propose a graph-based recommendation approach called ATRec to automatically assign tags to unlabeled APIs by exploiting both graph structure information and semantic similarity Specifically, ATRec first leverages the multi-type relations (ie, among APIs, mashups, and mashup assigned tags) to construct a heterogeneous network, in which a Random Walk with Restart (RWR) model is applied to alleviate the total cold start problem where no API has ever been tagged Furthermore, we apply the recommended API tags in two API management scenarios (API sea."
4,ICWS-Europe3,Web Services Based Architectures to Support Dynamic Inter-organizational Business Processes.,"Dynamic inter-organizational business processes are necessary to enable the flexible creation of partnerships in areas such as e-commerce and supply-chain-management Although many information system architectures for the support of static inter-organizational business processes exist, such architectures are still not available for supporting dynamic inter-organizational business processes In this paper the special requirements created by dynamic interorganizational business processes will be analyzed and the contributions of existing approaches and web services evaluated Based on the paradigm of the composite application, an architecture designed to support dynamic interorganizational business processes has been developed and will be introduced."

7,ICWS6,Decentralized Orchestration of CompositeWeb Services.,"Traditional, centralized orchestration of composite web services often leads to inefficient routing of messages To solve this problem, we present a novel scheme to execute composite web services in a fully decentralized way We introduce service invocation triggers, a lightweight infrastructure that routes messages directly from the producing service to the consuming one, enabling fully decentralized orchestration An evaluation confirms that decentralized orchestration can significantly reduce the network traffic when compared with centralized orchestration."
8,ICWS7,Monitoring E-Business Web Services Usage through a Log Based Architecture.,"The lament that students can't write' remains loud and defiant, even after years of research pointing to the myriad factors that make students' writing challenging, particularly when they move into university This paper reports on a longitudinal, ethnographic study which explored students' writing in transition', from A-levels to university in the UK, through the critical lens offered by the academic literacies conceptual framing This paper offers critical analysis of the ways that students, teachers and institutions position writing at A-level and university, exploring the assumptions and beliefs that underpin their understandings and practices using Ivani's framework of discourses of writing The analysis proposes that the centrality of assessment in the treatment of language at both levels creates an assessment discourse of writing', which originates in school, and becomes a defining and restrictive frame for students' writing as they move into higher education The analysis further ."
9,ICWS8,Control Flow Analysis and Coverage Driven Testing for Web Services.,"In this paper, we describe an approach to discover the control flow graph of web services for web services analysis, verification, and testing For this purpose, three novel methods are proposed First, we introduce a domain independent RDF Schemas for concise resource oriented functional specification of web services operations Secondly, we describe the use of RDF entailment to accurately derive the control flow from the functional specifications We developed a transformation from RDF graph to SPARQL query to facilitate the RDF entailment which offers flexibility and extensibility over the direct graph matching approach The third is a linkage based web services modeling and analysis framework, within which we apply an improved Google PageRank algorithm to efficiently calculate test coverage potential using the derived control flow We justify that the proposed linkage based web services modeling and analysis framework is particularly suitable for testing web services A prototype of the ."
10,ICWS9,Optimal Adaptation in Web Processes with Coordination Constraints.,"We present methods for optimally adapting Web processes to exogenous events while preserving inter-service constraints that necessitate coordination For example, in a supply chain process, orders placed by a manufacturer may get delayed in arriving In response to this event, the manufacturer has the choice of either waiting out the delay or changing the supplier Additionally, there may be compatibility constraints between the different orders, thereby introducing the problem of coordination between them if the manufacturer chooses to change the suppliers We focus on formulating the decision making models of the managers, who must adapt to external events while satisfying the coordination constraints, using Markov decision processes Our methods range from being centralized and globally optimal in their adaptation but not scalable, to decentralized that is suboptimal but scalable to multiple managers We also develop a hybrid approach that improves on the performance of the decentralized."
11,ICWS0,Enforcement from the Inside: Improving Quality of Business in Process Management.,"Young people with English as an Additional Language/Dialect backgrounds are often identified in public health messages and popular media as bodies at risk' because they do not conform to the health regimens of contemporary Western societies With increasing numbers of Chinese students in Australian schools, it is necessary to advance teachers' understandings of the ways in which these young people negotiate notions of health' and (un)healthy bodies' This paper explores the ways in which young Chinese Australians' understand health and (un)healthy bodies The data upon which this paper focuses were drawn from a larger scale study underpinned by critical, interpretive, ethnographic methods The participants in this study were 12 young Chinese Australians, aged 10-15 years, from two schools Photographs of a variety of bodies were sourced from popular magazines and used as a means of interview elicitation The young people were invited to comment on the photographs and discuss what health' an."
12,ICWS1,Scalable Optimized Composition of Web Services with Complexity Analysis.,"Nowadays, web services have become more popular and are the most preferred technology for distributed system development However, several issues related to the dynamic nature of the web still need to be addressed, such as scalability, high complexity, high computing costs and failure issues It becomes very important to find efficient solutions for the composition of web services, capable of handling different problems such as large quantities of services, semantics or user's constraints In this chapter, we formalize the web Service composition problem as a search problem in an AND/OR Service Dependency Graph, where nodes represent available services and arcs represent the semantic input/output dependencies among these services A set of dynamic optimization techniques based on redundancy analysis and service dominance has been included to reduce the size of this graph and thus improves the scalability and performance of our approach We pre-calculate all the shortest paths between each ."
